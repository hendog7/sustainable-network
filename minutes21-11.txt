zigbee has different freq.s
2.4 GHz same as wifi- lower energy- coin battery lasts year
wifi better for video cam
zigbee 800MHz, much lower
different freq.s some work better than others

ordering- small batches- need to know if don't work
interconnectivity
worth having one before Christmas

currently have zigbee shield and sensors

going to use smart plug as opposed to current sensors- need to strip wires- health and safety concern
automated zigbee comms w/ rasp pi, still need to setup zigbee w/ sensors

asking if sensors available in labs pre setup
order a sensor
need lab space

coral ai needs specific python- not much progress yet

home assistant OS on rasp pi, can use api w/ json to export data to website e.g.

okay to borrow pre-existing solutions if appropriate

actions:
-order-
	rasp pi 
	sensors

check xbees for frequency- range important (zigbee not good through walls- may use just one room)

book lab space- can have meetings in lab space
