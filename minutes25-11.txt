resistors for safety
if using one room, only need one Arduino. using smart plugs, so all components can be connected to a single one.
if we want to model multiple rooms then more than one Arduino needed.
asked if possible to geographically separate components whilst they're connected to the Arduino- unsure.
outdoor lights photoresistors connected to smart plugs- can detect power etc.
